Q:
Does MonthlyReport in Financial Year, format document contain calendar year sheets only? || Use sheet copy operation to preserve format||
For leave report, for a new employee, taking name and id not from the first sheet, for joining month ||removed all constraints||

I:
59 and 01 minutes can be rounded to the closest hour
Year-wise PTR, reading takes too long (10s)
various formats on hidden rows for ptr booking months
